		 * post-processing tasks.
		 *

		 * - Adding or modifying response headers
		 * - Setting cookies
		 * - Logging response metrics
		 * - Adding CORS headers
		 * - Compressing response content
		 * - Adding security headers

		 * @param Response $response The response object to be modified in-place.

		 *
		 * @return void No return value expected
